In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University when they created a website named
"Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web".[13][14] The site was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed
to a searchable index of pages. In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!"[15][16] The "yahoo.com"
domain was created on January 18, 1995.[17]

The word "yahoo" is a backronym for "Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"[18] or "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle".[19]
The term "hierarchical" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term "oracle" was intended to mean "source
of truth and wisdom", and the term "officious", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who
would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work.[20] However, Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the
slang definition of a "yahoo" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an
unsophisticated, rural Southerner): "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth." Filo's college girlfriend often referred to Filo as a "yahoo." This meaning
derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels.
